# A statistcal Arbitrage strategy using linear regression (Huber regressor) 

Here, we get a long term hedge ratio using linear regression coeficient of daily returns of two stocks and apply it for short term pairs (minute level) trading 


#Future Work:

1) Apply stoploss to the strategy
2) Find a better approach to find which pairs to trade
3) Instead of looking at the minute bars, real time bid-ask spread monitoring should provide excellent result. 
4) Set up a module for adverse execution management 
5) Trade multiple pairs at the same time to improve ROI
